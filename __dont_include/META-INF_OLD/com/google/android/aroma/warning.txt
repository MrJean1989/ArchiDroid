<@center><b>WARNING!</b>

Please pay attention to all informations on the following aroma questions. Don't change default option if you don't know what it's doing. Default ArchiDroid Installation will touch ONLY things directly associated with rom. However it has special possibility to flash also a recovery and the most important part - bootloader. YOU SHOULDN'T TOUCH BOOTLOADER UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DOING. It can cause unrecoverable problems and in fact can brick your phone if flashed without paying attention.

I suggest to don't risk and keep your bootloader untouched.

If you have any questions, opinions or suggestions please write them directly in my topic on xda:
