You've chosen custom DPI mode.
Please keep in mind that this is custom dpi mode and it won't work with all apps provided by Google Play, they'll show as incompatible ones. Don't panic tho, I've included Google Store fix in Xposed application. Please open xposed application after installation, install it and activate google store fix module by taping on checkbox on left from it. Lastly - reboot your device to apply changes.

For further help feel free to contact with me through my ArchiDroid's topic on xda.
