You've chosen ArchiDroid's AC!D & Noozxoide EIZO-rewire™ PRO config.

THIS IS PURE AWESOME, I can't express how happy I am with such awesome sound. This config mostly tweaks Noozxoide EIZO-rewire™ PRO for best sound experience as I could get.
First of all - This profile is based on my own taste and stock samsung headphones. It's really hard to make such change universal for everyone and because of that please note that overall you may or may not like it as well. It's really easy to modify it to your taste by using Noozxoide's app. Still I'm sure that sound is really good and you'll like it more than untouched samsung profile.

Please note that every person is different, we're listening to other music, we have different taste and different headphones. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE to make universal tweak for everyone. Because of that if you for whatever reason won't like my config then please open Noozxoide's app and tweak it yourself. It's really important because I can't do it for you :). I gave you powerful tool and you need to take control :).
