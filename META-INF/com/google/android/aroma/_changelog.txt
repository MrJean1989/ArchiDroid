ArchiDroid 1.6.3 XXUFME7
- [Backport] ArchiDroid_RunOnce improvements
# Googy Max kernel from AD 2.X used incompatible sqlite3 binary which caused RunOnce to enter infinite loop on every boot, causing battery drain and deep sleep prevention.
# It is now fixed and additionally I've implemented some important checks to prevent similar problems in the future. This does not hit 1.X of course but backporting improvement anyway.

- [Backport] Added/Implemented first ArchiDroid script - ArchiDroid_TemporaryUnroot
# ArchiDroid scripts are located in /data/media/0/ArchiDroid/Scripts and overwrited every flash with newest versions.
# The idea is simple - allow user to perform some tasks with just one click. So it's now simple, fast and reliable.
# ArchiDroid_TemporaryUnroot performs temporary unrooting "on the fly". This allows opening/using some apps which require the device to be unrooted.
# This is the very first version which is "working" by renaming /system/xbin/su and /system/bin/su so in fact system reports su command as not found.
# It's not universal and actually will work only with poorly-designed security of such anti-root apps. I'll try to implement something better in the future but as for now I'm out of ideas.
# Additionally root is automatically restored on reboot through 91ArchiDroid_RestoreRoot init.d script (which acts same as RunOnce). This process requires hard reboot which is also performed once through ArchiDroid_Init, fully automatically of course.
# More scripts will probably be implemented soon. Hope you'll enjoy this idea same as I do :)

- [Backport] ArchiDroid Scripts BIG update and improvements
* ArchiDroid_FstrimData - From Android 4.3 I'm happy to include fstrim "on demand" to ArchiDroid. By executing this script you call fstrim() on /data partition. If you want to learn more google "TRIM".
* ArchiDroid_FstrimAll - Same as above but also calls fstrim() on /cache /preload /system /efs in addition to /data. This is NOT recommended by me, as these partitions are RARELY being used in terms of writing but sometimes it may be useful to fstrim them as well.
# Please note that you SHOULD NOT fstrim too often. I'd say once per month is more than enough. I'd also advise to avoid other fstrim apps/scripts such as "LagFix", as my scripts do the same "on demand" and in natively way implemented directly in kernel.

* ArchiDroid_RestoreEFS - Restores /efs from backup made during flashing of ArchiDroid and reboots the system. Many people wanted to have such feature so here it is.
* ArchiDroid_RemoveArchiDroid - Removes ArchiDroid folder completely and reboots into recovery, allowing you to flash other ROM without any junk left by ArchiDroid. Please don't use this script during updates and cleaning, as ArchiDroid needs this folder.

- [Backport] Added inverted facebook (and messenger) to ArchiDroid apps.
# It was in .zip since at least 3 versions, I totally forgot to add it. Lawl =)

- [Backport] Reworked Google Apps and inverted policy
# First of all every Google App has been updated to latest version.
# Secondly all inverted apps are now installed as /system/app, NOT /data/app. This is because not every inverted app works as user app (f.e. YouTube or Google Keep). Also there's no point of having inverted apps installed as user app because they're not compatible with google play.
# Lastly I've added [Inverted] tag in aroma to all inverted google apps and archidroid apps. As for now it's... Google Calendar/Chrome/Ears/Keep/Mail/Maps/Hangouts/Now/Plus, Adobe Flash, Youtube, Facebook.
# Please remember that if you don't want to flash inverted version of selected app then don't choose it. The main point of having *that much* of google apps is to install inverted versions of them, as inverted versions are not available on google play.
# Also remember that inverted version saves your eyes and up to 3x more battery in terms of screen. This is how AMOLED works - black pixel requires up to 3x less energy than white one.
