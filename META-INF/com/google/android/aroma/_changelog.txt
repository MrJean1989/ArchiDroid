ArchiDroid 1.6.2 XXUFME7
- [!] [Backport] Deleted AC!D Sound System
# Let's make it clear. AC!D was cool back to froyo and GB times when simply flashing it made a difference. It was cool also on stock roms because of cm-based sound system with many improvements.
# For now AC!D contains basicly two things. Build.prop audio tweaks and AwesomeBeats. AwesomeBeats are really awesome and this is the only thing why I wanted to keep this implemented into my rom.
# Unfortunately Android 4.3 destroyed any DSP-Managers, not only AwesomeBeats. To be honest AC!D no longer makes sense to be implemented, there is no point in having broken package which doesn't make any difference in sound quality because of that.
# Because of that there is no longer a point of using it with CM10.2. Only strange issues would appear because of broken components.
# However this doesn't mean that I totally abandoned AC!D/AwesomeBeats.
# I've remastered, rewrited and ported all build.prop tweaks to ArchiDroid build.prop tweaks, gave proper credits and removed AC!D completely.
# I'm looking forward to any updates regarding CM10.2 support and if such thing happen then I'll be happy to implement this once again, but as for now I don't know if it's even possible, and if it is then still it needs a lot of time to be done.
# And lastly. Please keep in mind that there is still boeffla with original DSP-Manager, audio quality is still perfect. To be honest if there is EVEN any difference between AwesomeBeats and DSP-Manager then you can't hear it anyway. Even I can't ;)

- [!] [Backport] Implemented background function to ArchiDroid init.d scripts
# Now every ArchiDroid init.d script will check if it's running in the background and if not it'll fork itself with in-background.
# This is because kernel with init.d support executes init.d script and waits with the next script/action for previous one to finish. System and all further scripts were in fact slowed down because ArchiDroid init.d finishes execution after full boot, especially RunOnce.
# Now every script forks an independant child in background and exits with error code 1 to allow kernel execute further scripts without needing to wait for ArchiDroid to complete.
# If you're fast enough you can notice on logcat bootscreen that on the first boot ArchiDroid_RunOnce exits with code 1 (child spawned), ArchiDroid_PermFix exits with code 1 (child spawned) and Init exits with code 2 (RunOnce activated, halt). On every further boot ArchiDroid_Init with exit code 1 (child spawned)
# And lastly please notice, this isn't any major change or bugfix, it's more like cosmetic bugfix and improvement to ensure everything is working correctly. You won't see any real difference.

- [!] [Backport] Added (forced) ArchiDroid /EFS backup
# ArchiDroid now during flashing performs automatically a backup of your /efs.
# This is completely transparent process being executed during "Executing Archi's Scripts".
# I want to make sure that even if something goes wrong you'll still have a working backup of /efs "just in case".
# ArchiDroid stores maximum of 2 backups in /data/media/0/ArchiDroid/Backups. You can also find efs.txt there with more detailed information, backups date and how to restore them.
# Please note that such backups have a few kilobytes and I've implemented it only to ensure your safety, so maybe someday you'll say "ArchiDroid saved my Galaxy S3!" ;)
# I strongly suggest keeping these backups even if someday you decide to delete ArchiDroid completely.

* This includes also removing of option /efs backup from aroma because it's pointless now.
