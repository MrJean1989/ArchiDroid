<@center><b>WARNING!</b>

Please pay attention to all informations on the following aroma questions. Don't change default option if you don't know what it's doing. Default ArchiDroid Installation is already tweaked and configured according to my own taste and you don't need to change it in order to get best config.

If you have any questions, opinions or suggestions please write them directly in my topic on xda. I'm always happy to help my users!
