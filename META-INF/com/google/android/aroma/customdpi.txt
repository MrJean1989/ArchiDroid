<@center><b>WARNING!</b>

Keep in mind that DPIs other than 320 are not yet fully compatible with Samsung's Android 4.2.2. For best experience I highly suggest selecting non-TouchWiz launcher and non-Sammy keyboard (f.e. Nova and TouchPal). I also suggest installing Xposed and App Settings to easily force apps in 320 DPI mode.

Without Xposed you can notice some ui glitches f.e. phone dialer being in 320 DPI. Proceed only if you totally understand that.
